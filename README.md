## Project Overview
You have become the Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.              
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.               
Your final report should include each of the following:           
## District Summary            
Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:         
-	Calculate the total number of schools      
-	Calculate the total number of students        
-	Calculate the total budget        
-	Calculate the average math score         
-	Calculate the average reading score         
-	Calculate the overall passing rate (overall average score), i.e. (avg. math score + avg. reading score)/2          
-	Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)               
-	Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)            
-	Create a dataframe to hold the above results               
-	Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting
